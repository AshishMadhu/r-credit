## Intro
This is my semester's mini-project work. Like the Kadha-book app this is a website, the logic is the same. I've made this app very simple in that it uses only `django` and `djangorestframework` a little bit. But I tried to make this web site simple and advanced at the same time, many of my implementations are professional and you cannot find in youtube basic Django tutorials. You can add features on top of this application if you want.Â 

## Some features to be higlighted
* 30+ unit test written
* Well documented 

## Curious about the future updates
* Complete use of the Djangorestframework to use the server as a JSON exporter.
* Will use ReactJs for Front-end
* Realtime sync between you and your debtor using a hybrid application may be with flutter or react-native (will choose according to the situation)
* Easy Management of your credits on desktop with a hybrid desktop software made using ElectronJS.

## Quick Dependency check
- django
- djangorestframework

## How to use
I think it worth mentioning how to using the website, if you have time and like learning things yourself this is not for you sir.
